The “Secret” Sauce
Looking under the hood of Claude
Front-load context with tiny targeted prompts
System reminders everywhere including system/user prompts, tool calls, tool results to prevent drift (<system-reminder> tags)
Command prefix extraction
Spawns sub agents (likely to help with preventing context overloading)

Limitations
Agents don’t handle many tools very well today
APIs eat up your context window quickly
Design APIs to be AI-native rather that rigid

MCP A Bit Deeper
Terminology
Host: Cursor, Claude Desktop
MCP Client: Library embedded on host (stateful session per server)
MCP Server: Lightweight wrapper in front of a tool 
Tool: Callable function (could be data source, API)
Flow
Client calls tools/list to MCP server (what can you do?)
Server returns JSON describing each tool (name, summary, JSON schema)
Host injects that JSON into model’s context
User prompt triggers model, emitting a structured tool call
MCP server executes and conversation resumes
MCP provides stdio and SSE transport layer
