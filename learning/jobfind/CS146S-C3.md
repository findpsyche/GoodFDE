Best practices
--
Goal
	What is the purpose of the change
Definitions
	What prereqs does the LLM need to know about the problem
Plan
	High-level implementation breakdown
Source files being changed
	What parts of the codebase are relevant and why
Test cases
	How will testing be done
Edge cases
	What special cases need to be accounted for
Out-of-scope
	What should *not* be changed
Extensions
	What changes will be relevant later so the LLM can future-proof its design and not take shortcuts

Optimize your codebase so that a human and an agent could understand what’s going on
Much of LLM confusion comes from trying to finish a task with a messy repo as context
Provide optimal context for LLMs by describing
	Repo orientation
	File structure
	Setup and environment
	Best practices
	Code style
	Access patterns
	APIs and contracts
	All of this should be thoroughly documented
	Tip: a monorepo design in your repo is highly encouraged

Help LLM navigate your codebase with agent configurations
	claude.md
		CLAUDE.md is a special file that Claude automatically pulls into context when starting a conversation. This makes it an ideal place for documenting: common bash commands, core files and utility functions, code style guidelines, testing instructions.
	cursorrules
	AGENTS.md 	
		Open format 
	llms.txt
		Provide that navigation guidance for LLMs scraping the web
	Note: The agents won’t always adhere to these descriptions/directives. They are intended as guidance.
