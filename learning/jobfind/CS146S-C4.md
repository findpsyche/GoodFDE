Techniques for directing agents
Aent behavior files (Claude.md/Cursorrules/agents.md)
Hooks
Commands
Subagents


Hooks
Deterministic scripts that run on predefined event types
PreToolUse
PostToolUse
UserPromptSubmit
PreCompact
…and more

Commands
Provide frequently-used prompts as files that the agent can execute
Use cases
Running tests
Reviewing code
Form a git commit, push

Subagents
Runtime delegation
Purposes of a subagent is to
Create distinct developer personas for different types of work (frontend, backend, etc)
Cleanly separate contexts for different work streams
Offer
Customized system prompts, tools, and a separate context window
A move toward agents managing other agents

Best practices
You need careful backstops	
Tests in codebase
CI/CD best practices
Auditability of each agent
Label every diff made by an agent 
Different models for different classes of tasks
More complex tasks you may need to handhold a bit more upfront vs fully async ones
Checkpoint (commit) regularly
